### My Background
I am a military brat and lived in various locations around the world depending on the current political climate. Vietnam and the Cold War are baked into my psyche. I bought a camera while living in Germany and learned how to develop film and make prints. At some point I decided I wanted to be a photographer so I attended Arizona State University and ended up working at the Arizona Republic for a time as a photographer.

Most photographers are gear heads and I bought a [Tandy Model 200](http://oldcomputers.net/trs200.html) (I am sure I desperately tried to justify this purchase to my wife in some way). It came with a 300 baud modem and a Compuserve account. From there I discovered the web and the rest is, as they say, history.

The idea of the web as a publishing platform fascinated me and it still does to this day. I spent late nights on the Apple computer in my bedroom trying to figure out how web pages were made. I begged the folks that were instrumental in starting up AzCentral.com, the online group at the newspaper, for a job.

They finally succumbed and I spent four incredible years there leaving my photography behind. I learned a great deal and I will always be thankful for that opportunity. I ran a group that built and hosted websites for customers, eventually becoming Director of Operations. For a short time I had the job title of "Digital Explorer" (it was the dot-com era folks) that enabled me to think about new products and strategy.

### Chicago
I left Arizona for career and family reasons and joined Tribune Media Services in Chicago. They were starting up a filtered content service targeted at the enterprise and it was a great fit with my interest in content syndication technologies. After four years they sold the business and I moved on.

Next up was Highbeam Research, founded by Patrick Spain. I worked on content acquisition there and learned a ton about customer acquisition, A/B testing and how to analyze content in terms of its value to the business. Not being a numbers guy I was pretty intimidated by the analytical approach, but I learned to love the metrics. They helped focus the team everyday.

I was lured back to TMS to help them design and implement a new content syndication platform for the News and Features division. We replaced the old system with a new platform that would enable new business models. Newspapers were not ready for anything new and frankly I was getting bored.

### Today
I am a product manager at [Gracenote](http://www.gracenote.com). That means a lot of things. Mostly I am responsible for [OnConnect](http://developer.tmsapi.com), our api platform. I am also working on sports and a few other content-related projects. I like working with developers and learning from them. They are creative, outspoken and help me improve the product every day.

The world of entertainment and television is rapidly changing and I love thinking strategically about the impact this is having on our business. The way we collect, store and deliver content will change. 

### Content and technology
In my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fioritto) I state that I'm interested in the "intersection of content and technology". I should be bold and appropriate [Robin Sloan's](http://www.robinsloan.com/about/) label, "media inventor". A media inventor is someone who is "interested in content who also experiments with new formats, new tools and new technology".

Maybe instead of inventor I should use the term "tinkerer". While at AzCentral, I stumbled across [Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com), [Radio UserLand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand) and [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Looking back at the trajectory of my career I owe him a debt of gratitude at least. I was thinking about how we could create new products from the content we generated and collected every day. Thus my interest in syndication.

I was interested in the idea of using blogging tools like Radio UserLand as a content management system, but I was more intrigued with RSS and syndication. Along the way I setup my first blog using Radio, then migrated that to Movable Type and finally Wordpress. I never wrote much, but used the experience to explore, learn and tinker with tools that would change the web.

I continue to tinker today. I am fascinated with the semantic web  and admire the work the BBC and others have done. I was deeply influenced by the thinking behind David Weinberger's book, "[Small Pieces Loosely Joined: A Unified Theory Of The Web](http://www.amazon.com/Small-Pieces-Loosely-Joined-ebook/dp/B009G1T1OK/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1383504805&sr=1-5&keywords=david+weinberger)" and that plays into my current interest in combining data from various services using apis.

Today, this site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I hope the tinkering never ends.

### Photography
After a hiatus of 10 years, I started shooting again. Today I shoot a mix of film and digital. I am still trying to figure out how to manage all this from a workflow perspective. More to come in another post.

I created my first Blurb book, "Rodeo: Paris, Texas" and you can find it [here](http://www.blurb.com/b/5397924-rodeo-paris-texas).

I am also very interested in photo history. [Bill Jay](http://www.fioritto.us/blog/bill-jay-1940-2009/1497/) was an early influence. 

### Cycling
I ride as much as I can with the FOGOBS group in Hyde Park. Depending on who you ask, it stands for either Fast or Fat Old Guys On Bikes. I commute to work via bike, but I'm not a dedicated commuter. If its wet outside I'm on the bus.

### Personal
I am married to Lisa, have three children and three grand children, all boys. I love being "papa". We live in Hyde Park.

### Resume
Everything above in a bulleted list.
