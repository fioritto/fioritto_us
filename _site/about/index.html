        <h3 id="my-background">My Background</h3>
<p>I am a military brat and lived in various locations around the world depending on the current political climate. Vietnam and the Cold War are baked into my psyche. I bought a camera while living in Germany and learned how to develop film and make prints. At some point I decided I wanted to be a photographer so I attended Arizona State University and ended up working at the Arizona Republic for a time as a photographer.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.fioritto.us/images/mike-fioritto-portrait.jpg" alt="Self Portrait" /></p>

<p>Most photographers are gear heads and I bought a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/trs200.html">Tandy Model 200</a> (I am sure I desperately tried to justify this purchase to my wife in some way). It came with a 300 baud modem and a Compuserve account. From there I discovered the web and the rest is, as they say, history.</p>

<p>The idea of the web as a publishing platform fascinated me and it still does to this day. I spent late nights on the Apple computer in my bedroom trying to figure out how web pages were made. I begged the folks that were instrumental in starting up AzCentral.com, the online group at the newspaper, for a job.</p>

<p>They finally succumbed and I spent four incredible years there leaving my photography behind. I learned a great deal and I will always be thankful for that opportunity. I ran a group that built and hosted websites for customers, eventually becoming Director of Operations. For a short time I had the job title of &#8220;Digital Explorer&#8221; (it was the dot-com era folks) that enabled me to think about new products and strategy.</p>

<h3 id="chicago">Chicago</h3>
<p>I left Arizona for career and family reasons and joined Tribune Media Services in Chicago. They were starting up a filtered content service targeted at the enterprise and it was a great fit with my interest in content syndication technologies. After four years they sold the business and I moved on.</p>

<p>Next up was Highbeam Research, founded by Patrick Spain. I worked on content acquisition there and learned a ton about customer acquisition, A/B testing and how to analyze content in terms of its value to the business. Not being a numbers guy I was pretty intimidated by the analytical approach, but I learned to love the metrics. They helped focus the team everyday.</p>

<p>I was lured back to TMS to help them design and implement a new content syndication platform for the News and Features division. We replaced the old system with a new platform that would enable new business models. Newspapers were not ready for anything new and frankly I was getting bored.</p>

<h3 id="today">Today</h3>
<p>I am the Director for Content Delivery at <a href="http://www.tribunemediaservices.com">TMS</a>. That means a lot of things. Mostly I am the product manager for <a href="http://developer.tmsapi.com">OnConnect</a>, our api platform. I like working with developers and learning from them. They are creative, outspoken and help me improve the product every day.</p>

<p>The world of entertainment and television is rapidly changing and I love thinking strategically about the impact this is having on our business. The way we collect, store and deliver content will change. </p>

<h3 id="content-and-technology">Content and technology</h3>
<p>In my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/fioritto">LinkedIn profile</a> I state that I&#8217;m interested in the &#8220;intersection of content and technology&#8221;. I should be bold and appropriate <a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/about/">Robin Sloan&#8217;s</a> label, &#8220;media inventor&#8221;. A media inventor is someone who is &#8220;interested in content who also experiments with new formats, new tools and new technology&#8221;.</p>

<p>Maybe instead of inventor I should use the term &#8220;tinkerer&#8221;. While at AzCentral, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand">Radio UserLand</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>. Looking back at the trajectory of my career I owe him a debt of gratitude at least. I was thinking about how we could create new products from the content we generated and collected every day. Thus my interest in syndication.</p>

<p>I was interested in the idea of using blogging tools like Radio UserLand as a content management system, but I was more intrigued with RSS and syndication. Along the way I setup my first blog using Radio, then migrated that to Movable Type and finally Wordpress. I never wrote much, but used the experience to explore, learn and tinker with tools that would change the web.</p>

<p>I continue to tinker today. I am fascinated with the semantic web  and admire the work the BBC and others have done. I was deeply influenced by the thinking behind David Weinberger&#8217;s book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Small-Pieces-Loosely-Joined-ebook/dp/B009G1T1OK/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383504805&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=david+weinberger">Small Pieces Loosely Joined: A Unified Theory Of The Web</a>&#8221; and that plays into my current interest in combining data from various services using apis.</p>

<p>Today, this site is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I hope the tinkering never ends.</p>

<h3 id="photography">Photography</h3>
<p>After a hiatus of 10 years, I started shooting again. Today I shoot a mix of film and digital. I am still trying to figure out how to manage all this from a workflow perspective. More to come in another post.</p>

<p>I am also very interested in photo history. <a href="http://www.fioritto.us/blog/bill-jay-1940-2009/1497/">Bill Jay</a> was an early influence. </p>

<h3 id="cycling">Cycling</h3>
<p>I ride as much as I can with the FOGOBS group in Hyde Park. Depending on who you ask, it stands for either Fast or Fat Old Guys On Bikes. I commute to work via bike, but I&#8217;m not a dedicated commuter. If its wet outside I&#8217;m on the bus.</p>

<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>
<p>I married to Lisa, have three children, one grandchild and another on the way. I love being &#8220;papa&#8221;. We live in Hyde Park.</p>

<h3 id="resume">Resume</h3>
<p>Everything above in a bulleted list.</p>
