            <p class="date">Nov 03, 2013</p>
            <p class="intro">Based on The Setup interviews. I have always been interested in how others get their work done. Here's my setup.</p>
          </hgroup>

        <h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h3>
<p>Answer <a href="http://www.fioritto.us/about/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h3>
<p>At work I currently have a Dell laptop that gets docked when I am in the office. Connected to that is a twenty-something-inch monitor. This setup will be replaced soon with an Apple MacBook Air. I have been working with Windows machines for some time so I&#8217;m making a list now of potential software to replace some of the tools I use today.</p>

<p>At home I have a Dell tower connected to dual twenty-something-inch monitors. I primarily use this machine for processing and managing photos. I calibrate the monitors often and when the RSI kicks in I have an older Wacom Bamboo device that I can use with a pen. It also comes in handy when doing a lot of retouching in Photoshop.</p>

<p>Along with hard drive it came with, I installed a 2TB internal drive to store my photo archive. I back that up to an external drive which I should start storing off site somewhere.</p>

<p>A few months ago I purchased a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/chromebook">Samsung Chromebook</a>. I use it at home to develop, surf the web and manage email. I also take it with me when I travel, although checking two laptops is a pain. I&#8217;m working more and more in the cloud these days and I liked the price, form factor and capabilities of the Chromebook.</p>

<p>I have an original Kindle that I use to read. I prefer it over the iPad or laptop.</p>

<p>I have a work issued iPad that I use to review television related apps and monitor Twitter and other content via <a href="http://www.flipboard.com">Flipboard</a>. I also download and read the occasional pdf file. If I did not have it I would miss Flipboard, but that is about it. </p>

<p>I have an iPhone 4 something and I am thinking about moving to the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxys4/">Samsung Galaxy S4</a> given my Chromebook use and reliance on Google products. [11/8/2013 - made the switch and am loving the S4). I have an unlocked Motorola Droid Pro that I am keeping around because of its GSM capabilities and SIM card.</p>

<p>I shoot with Leica M cameras and a variety of lenses. I have an M6, M4-2 and 35mm and 50mm lenses. I use the 35mm 85% of the time and I&#8217;m trying to use the 50mm more. I also have an old 50mm Russian made lens, a 40mm Voigtlander and an older 35mm screw mount Canon lens. They get limited use depending on my mood. I am currently shooting black and white film (Kodak Tri-X) but I am thinking about switching my workflow to color neg film. It will save me the processing time and it is easier to scan.</p>

<p>I also have an old Canon Rebel digital that I use off an on. I almost ditched everything to purchase a Fuji X Pro system, but I&#8217;m going to hold off for now.</p>

<h3 id="what-software">What software?</h3>
<p>Today, I am working with more and more software that is in the cloud. Through the years I have experimented with a lot of software. I would download it, give it a trial and then it would often linger unused, contributing to the eventual cruftiness of my machine. I like the ability to try things out without having to install anything.</p>

<p>My current favorite software is <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>. I have it installed on my work laptop and I use the web based version everywhere else. I use it to store my research notes, clip content from the web and keep track of projects. I make use of the Skitch integration to grab screen shots for presentations and product design. </p>

<p>I am using Google docs more and more, both at work and personally. Docs, sheets and presentations. Microsoft Office still comes into play, but I&#8217;m using it less and less.</p>

<p>For web development on the Windows machines, I use Notepad++ and ftp (I am not a developer, so I do some lightweight work on our developer portal and this site). On the Chromebook I am using Cloud9, git, github and secure shell for web development. I like the combination of having an editor and shell access in the same cloud based application. </p>

<p>I am using Jekyll to build out this site and instead of migrating all of my old Wordpress content I just archived it. I am trying to learn git so I use it for version control and backup the project to Github. I have an rsync script that moves the html files to my public_html directory at fioritto.us. (11/8/2013 - I forgot to remove one switch in the rsync script and I blew away all of the files in my public_html directory. I&#8217;m wating for news on a backup from my hosting company. If I can&#8217;t restore things, then no archive blog and more. I learn the hard way.)</p>

<p>To manage my varied interests, I use Feedly to keep track of various blogs (after Google Reader was shut down) and much of my news flow now comes from Twitter. I use Tweetdeck to keep up with that flow and to post to both my personal and work account.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="http://www.getpocket.com">Pocket</a> to TiVo content I want to read later. I works well on my Chromebook and if there is something I want to keep or an item that is part of a research project, I then use the Evernote Chrome extension to clip it into a notebook.</p>

<p>At work I live in Outlook. We use it for email and calendaring. I have been using it for years and am used to it by now, althogh I don&#8217;t like flipping between it and Gmail. For personal use I use Gmail and still have a Yahoo! account I check about once a week.</p>

<p>I use Google Hangouts, Skype, Webex and Lync (corporate im tool) for video conferencing and instant messaging.</p>

<p>For photography I am in the process of fine tuning my workflow. I&#8217;m moving to Lightroom and will begin experimenting with that to process my images as well. To date I have used Photoshop exclusively with a folder system for keeping track of original scans, derivative files and final work.</p>

<p>By now you have probably figured out that I live in Google Chrome. I have not used Firefox in over a year and I have to use Microsoft Explorer at work for a couple of internal applications.</p>

<p>Overall, moving much of my work to the cloud has been a good experience. With Jekyll, I like the fact that I could use Text offline in my Chromebook and then upload files when I&#8217;m connected. Cloud9 has been working pretty well and I save often out of years of experience with losing work.</p>

<p>Finally I use LastPass to keep track of all of my logins.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h3>
<p>I am not much of a hardware geek, but I am looking forward to getting the MacBook Air. It is light, powerful and most interesting to me, I can drop down into the command line to manage things if I want (See note above on my command line skills. This is probably something I should practice more).</p>

<p>On the photography front I&#8217;m holding out for a <a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/photography/m_system/m_monochrom/">Leica Monochrom</a> body. I primarly shoot in black and white and I have been intrigued with this since it came out. I have the lenses, now I just need the body to make the move to an all digital workflow.</p>

<p>Otherwise I enjoy seeing and trying out new products and services developers create. </p>
